# RAGE CFG Maker

## About
This is a clone of a website created and hosted by "[Do Not Argue](https://www.donotargue.com)", which allows players to make improved configuration file for ID Software's 2011 RAGE.

I've modified it to remove unnecesary and outdated bloat, like:
* Google Analytics
* Google Ads
* Facebook SDK
* Unnecessary information about the game itself
* Footer with outdated info
* Unused CSS

I've also made the text on a dark translucent field look more in line with the stylisation of the game's title on promotional artwork and made an image behind it work offline.

## Usage
Simply download the files from the repository and open .htm file with your web browser of choice (tested on Firefox).

Easiest way to do it:
